# Hello, World!


Your first step is to create a file named "Main.th".
In that file, enter the following code:
```Rose
module Main where

impure main<[String] -> Int>
main _ {
    printLn "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run this program, enter the following in
your the directory of your "Main.hs" file from your
terminal:
```Bash
> rose Main.th
Building [Main]
Build Finished in 0.0005s
> ./main
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations!

Heres a breakdown of the contents of the "Main.th" file:

On the first line, we have the module declaration
`module Main where`. For the time being, this has no real
purpose.

On the third line, we declare the entry-point for the
program: `impure main<[String] -> Void>`. This declares
the function `main` as impure (we'll get to what that
means later), with an array of `String`s as the input,
and returns an `Int`. The input is the arguments given
to the executable, which in this case is nothing.

On the fourth line, we begin defining the entry-function.
We start with the name of the function, in this case
`main`. After that, we declare the names of the
parameters. In this case, we dont use them, so we use an
underscore to tell Rose that the parameter will not be
used.

The body of the function is enclosed is curly-braces
("{" and "}"). The first statement is `printLn "Hello,
World"`. This print "Hello, World" to the console, and
ends the line. We then `return 0` to end the function.
